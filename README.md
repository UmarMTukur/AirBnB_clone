The Console: 0x00. AirBnB clone

65f4a1dd9c51265f49d0
Description

This repository contains the first steps of the AirBnB clone project made for Holberton/ALX_Africa students. During this first part of the project we had to:

    Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.
    Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
    Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
    Create a command interpreter that can:

        create a new object (eg. a new User or a new Place)
        retrieve an object from a file
        update attributes of an object
        destroy an object

Files and directories description
Directory 	Description
Models 	contains all the classes used (eg. BaseModel, User, City, etc.)
Models/Engine 	contains the file file_storage.py that holds class FileStorage
Tests 	contains all unit tests
Usage

The following is how the interpreter works in interactive mode.

help: displays the commands the interpreter can use

~/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

It should work like this in non-interactive mode.

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$

create: creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id

(hbnb) create BaseModel
79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4  # BaseModel id number

show: prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id update: updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (saves the change into the JSON file)

(hbnb) show BaseModel 79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4
[BaseModel] (79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4) {'id': '79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 23, 34, 49, 766357), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 23, 34, 49, 766389)}
(hbnb)
(hbnb) update BaseModel 79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4 first_name "Betty"
(hbnb)
(hbnb) show BaseModel 79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4
[BaseModel] (79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4) {'first_name': 'Betty', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 23, 34, 49, 766389), 'id': '79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 23, 34, 49, 766357)}

destroy: deletes an instance based on the class name and id

(hbnb) destroy BaseModel 79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4
(hbnb)
(hbnb) show BaseModel 79ee3ea4-3851-4ceb-bf88-8bc535190ee4
** no instance found **

quit: command to exit the interpreter

(hbnb) exit
*** Unknown syntax: exit
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
~/AirBnb_clone$  # successfully exited the interpreter
